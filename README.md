# Bryan Kleinberg Portfolio

## Description

Personal project portfolio based on template https://krozo.ibthemespro.com/home-light.
The biggest changes I made to the template:
    - On click of project image, load a project detials modal instead of just image. 
    - Added custom skills badges for all skills instead of block list. Made this section mobile responsive.
    - Hooked up contact me form to a custom FastApi simple mail transfer protocol server to send e-mails to my personal e-mail. https://github.com/bmklei8p/email_service
    - Avatar picture used instead of text logo.
    - UI/UX changes for styling and resposiveness
